# Cryptography
 Code made to make my Cryptography class easier.

# All code was written in my spare time. No code was apart of any assignment at the point of their upload.

## Includes

* c++:

  * caesar.cpp - encrypts a message using the Caesar Shift cipher.

  * decaesar.cpp - decrypts a message using the Caesar Shift cipher.

  * multiplicative.cpp  - encrypts a message using the Multiplicative cipher.
    * currently only works with valid alphabets. nonvalid alphabets will not throw an error.

  * demultiplicative.cpp  - decrypts a message using the Multiplicative cipher.
    * currently only works with valid alphabets. nonvalid alphabets will not throw an error.

  * inverse.cpp - finds the inverse of the KEY used in the Multiplicative cipher in 26 space.

  * affine.cpp - encrypts a message using the Affine Cipher.
    * currently only works with valid alphabets. nonvalid alphabets will not throw an error.

  * deaffine.cpp - decrypts a message using the Affine Cipher.
    * currently only works with valid alphabets. nonvalid alphabets will not throw an error.

* Python:
  * caesar.py - encrypts a message using the Caesar Shift cipher.

  * decaesar.py - decrypts a message using the Caesar Shift cipher.

  * affine.py - encrypts a message using the Affine Cipher.

  * deaffine.py - decrypts  a message using the Affine Cipher.
